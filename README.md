# Autonomous-Weed-Remover-
In India, weeds are removed by manual plucking, which a quite expensive and time consuming method. Inorder to reduce the drudgery and provide an intelligent automation, we have built a economically feasible, energy efficient, and an acquiescent weed remover machine that is applicable in wide variety of farms. 
We have used laser sensor and detector to detect the presence of weeds on grounds, signals the motor of cutter to  turn on that uprooots the weed, and VL53LOX (mounted at the upper part) to detect the presence of main crop and moves away from it so there is no harm to the main crop. To prevent the cutting tool from wear we also embedded an security alarm system.
